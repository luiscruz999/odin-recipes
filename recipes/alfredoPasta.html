    <h1>Alfredo Pasta</h1>

    This is my favorite pasta dish of all time, and as a added bonus it's very simple to make.

    <p></p>

    <h2>Ingridents</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>24 oz Fettucini Pasta (My preffered choice of pasta, but any can do)</li>
        <li>1 Cup of Butter</li>
        <li>1/4 Pint of Cream</li>
        <li>Seasoings (salt, pepper, garlic powder)</li>
        <li>Shredded Cheese (3/4 cup of Romano and 1/2 Parmesean)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><h3>Boil Pasta</h3></li>
        In a large pot add lightly salted water and bring to a boil. <br>
        Add Fettucini pasta and let it cook for about 8 to 10 minutes and then drain the water out.

        <p></p>

        <li><h3>Prep Sauce</h3></li>
        Now we start prepairing our sauce, melt our butter into the cream in a large sauce pan <br>
        over low heat. Once melted and mixed, add salt, pepper and garlic powder.
        <p></p>

        <li><h3>Cheese Up Sauce</h3></li>
        Here comes the best part, go ahead and increase the heat to medium. <br>
        Stir in our shredded romano and parmasean cheese until melted and <>
        our sauce should be thickend when ready. 

        <p<></p>

        <li><h3>Mix and Plate</h3></li>
        Now that your sauce is ready, go ahead and toss the pasta into the sauce.<br>
        Mix the sauce with the pasta and you're done, it is ready to be plated and eaten.

    </ol>
