        <p></p>

        <h3>For the Buffalo Sauce</h3>
        <li>4 Tbsp of Butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of Frank's Redhot Sauce (or preffered hotsauce)</li>
        <li>1 Tsp of Worcesteshire Sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 Tsp Garlic Powder</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        
        <li><h3>Prep Time</h3></li>
        Go ahead pre heat your oven to 400˚. While it heats up, grab a bowl<br>
        and mix cornstarch, paprika, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder,<br>
        cayenne, pepper and salt in it. 

        <p></p>

        <li><h3>Wings Prep</h3></li>
        Pat the wings dry with a paper towel. Place the wings in a seperate bowl<br>
        and drizzle the cooking oil over them and toss until fully coated.<br>
        With the wings now oil coated, we can now add the cornstarch mix.<br>
        Toss one more time, until wings are coated with all the seasoings.

        <p></p>
        
        <li><h3>Baking Time</h3></li>
        On a baking sheet, line a parchment paper for easy cleanup with a wire cooling rack on top.<br>
        Place the chicken wings on the cooling rack with some slight space betwen them. <br>
        Insert the naking sheet into the oven and let them cook for 30 minutes. At the 30 minute mark,<br>
        take out the sheet and flip the wings to the other side and bake for another 20-25 minutes or<br>
        until desired doneness. 

        <p></p>
        
        <li><h3>Sauce Time</h3></li>
        While the wings are cooking, preferably after you flip, is the perfect time to make<br>
        our buffalo sauce. In a sauce pan, melt the butter over medium heat and mix in the hot sauce,<br>
        garlic powder, and worcesteshire sauce.

        <p></p>

        <li><h3>Final Coat</h3></li>
        With our wings and sauce ready, we can now take a large bowl and toss our wings and sauce in it<br>
        and allow the wings to get fully coated with our buffalo sauce. Wings are now ready to be plated and served.
