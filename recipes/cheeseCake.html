    <h1>NY Cheesecake</h1>

    If i could choose any dessert to eat for the rest of my life it is this one. <br>
    Theres so many varieties, but you can never go wrong with some plain cheesecake.

    <p></p>
    
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Graham Cracker Crumbs</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Cream Cheese</li>
        <li>All Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>Lemon Zest/Juice</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Sour Cream</li>
        <li>Springform Pan</li>

    </ul>

    <p></p>

    <ol>
        <li><h3>Prep Pan & Oven</h3></li>
        Start by pre heating your oven to 375°. Wrap the springform pan with 2 layers of heavy<br>
        duty foil on both the sides and bottom. When done, spray the inside of the pan with <br>
        nonsitck cooking spray. 

        <p></p>

        <li><h3>Make the Crust</h3></li>
        In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter sugar and salt. Once mixed,<br>
        you can layer the bottom of the pan to form your crust. Place in the oven for about 10 minutes. 

        <li><h3>Cheesecake Batter</h3></li>

        With an electric mixer, combine the cream cheese, sugar, and flour into it's bowl and let it mix<br>
        until you get that cheesecake mix texture. Then, mix in the vanilla extract, lemon zest or juice, and<br>
        salt. Set the mix setting to low and add the eggs one a time and lastly the sour cream until the batter<br>
        mix is uniform. 

        <p></p>

        <li><h3>Assemble</h3></li>

        You can now pour the cheesecake batter into the graham crust.

        <p></p>
        
        <li><h3>Bake</h3></li>

        Place the unbaked cheesecake in a larger pan, and add boiling water outside the foiled pan up to an inch.<br>
        This water bath is to allow the cheesecake to gently cook, otherwise the cheescake can crack up or be dry.<br>
        Bake in the oven at 325° until the cheesecake is set, if it looks like liquid it isnt ready yet. You can also<br>
        wobble it, should only gently wobble.

        <p></p>

        <li><h3>Remove and Chill</h3></li>

        Remove the cheesecake from the over and let it rest in the water bath for about 45 minutes. Remove the foil and<br>
        springform pan and refrigrate the cheesecake for 8 hours, or preferably over night. Your cheesecake is now ready.<br>
        You can either eat and share after the time is up, or if there is any left over you can freeze it and will be <br>
        good to eat up to 3 months.
