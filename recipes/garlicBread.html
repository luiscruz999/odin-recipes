    <h2>Ingridients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Bread - Italian or loaf of french bread will do</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup of soft butter</li>
        <li>Garlic - Actual fresh garlic cloves, garlic powder will not do as a substitue</li>
        <li>Harbs & Spices - Salt and Parsley</li>
    </ul>

        lined up with the baking sheet we will be using.
